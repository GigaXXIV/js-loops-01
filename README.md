### Every 2
Using a `for` loop, print every second number e.g. 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.

### 9 to 3
Using a `for` loop, print backwards from 9 to 3 e.g. 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3.

### 9 Times Table
Write a program that prints exactly the following using a `for` loop:

``` text
9 Times Table
================
9 times 0 is 0
9 times 1 is 9
9 times 2 is 18
9 times 3 is 27
9 times 4 is 36
9 times 5 is 45
9 times 6 is 54
9 times 7 is 63
9 times 8 is 72
9 times 9 is 81
9 times 10 is 90
================
```

### Even/Odd Reporter
Use a `for` loop that will iterate from 1 to 20. For each iteration, check if the current number is even or odd, and log it in the console (e.g. "2 is even").

``` text
1 is odd
2 is even
3 is odd
4 is even
5 is odd
// etc
```
